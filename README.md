# MNED - Multimodal News Event Discovery dataset

Welcome to the repository for the Multimodal News Event Discovery (MNED) dataset. This dataset collects a large number of samples for each event, and it can be used in the research of generalized news event detection algorithms.

## Dataset Overview
The MNED dataset consists of 161,350 multimodal samples annotated with 66 real-world events from Twitter. Reflecting the temporal characteristics of news events, we define and collect three types of news events: short-term, cyclical, and long-term events. To ensure diversity, each event type encompasses a broad range of sub-events, including short-term events like natural and man-made disasters, terrorist attacks; cyclical events such as sporting events, political elections, international summits; and long-term events covering political conflicts, economic/social crises, and environmental/health issues. More details can be found in Event_list.pdf.

## Contributions and Acknowledgments
Contributions to the dataset and the related benchmarks are welcome. If you have suggestions or updates, please contact the repository administrators.

We appreciate all contributors and collaborators who have made this dataset possible and look forward to seeing the innovations it will enable in the realm of news event discovery.
