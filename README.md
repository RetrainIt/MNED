# MNED - Multimodal News Event Discovery dataset

Welcome to the repository for the Multimodal News Event Discovery (MNED) dataset. This dataset collects a large number of samples for each event, and it can be used in the research of generalized news event detection algorithms.

## Dataset Overview
The MNED dataset consists of 161,350 multimodal samples annotated with 66 real-world events from Twitter. Reflecting the temporal characteristics of news events, we define and collect three types of news events: short-term, cyclical, and long-term events. To ensure diversity, each event type encompasses a broad range of sub-events, including short-term events like natural and man-made disasters, terrorist attacks; cyclical events such as sporting events, political elections, international summits; and long-term events covering political conflicts, economic/social crises, and environmental/health issues. More details can be found in Event_list.pdf.
